# GettingAndCleaningData

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. We will be graded by our peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. We will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with out script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that we performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. We should also include a README.md in the repo with our scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

 We should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Step 1: Merge the training and the test sets to create one dataset.

Load the data from the UCI HAR Dataset
* activity_labels <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt")
* features <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt")

Test Data
* x_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt")
* y_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt")
* subject_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt")

Train Data
* x_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt")
* y_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt")
* subject_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt")

Merging the training and test sets 
* x.set <- rbind(x_test, x_train)
* y.set <- rbind(y_test, y_train)
* subjects.set <- rbind(subject_test, subject_train)

Setting column names
* data_labels <- features$V2
* colnames(x.set) <- data_labels
* names(subjects.set) <- "subjectID"
* names(y.set) <- "activity"

Combine files into one dataset
* combined <- cbind(subjects.set,y.set,x.set)

## Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Determine which columns contain "mean" or "std"
* mean_and_std_features <- grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)", names(combined)) 

Adding subjectID and activity columns
* mean_and_std_features <- append(1:2, mean_and_std_features)

Remove unnecessary columns
* combined <- combined[, mean_and_std_features]

## Step3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Convert the activity column from integer to factor

for (i in 1:6) {
  combined$activity[y.set$activity == i] <- as.character(activity_labels[i,2])  
}

## Step4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* names(combined)<-gsub("Acc", "Accelerometer", names(combined))
* names(combined)<-gsub("Gyro", "Gyroscope", names(combined))
* names(combined)<-gsub("BodyBody", "Body", names(combined))
* names(combined)<-gsub("Mag", "Magnitude", names(combined))
* names(combined)<-gsub("^t", "Time", names(combined))
* names(combined)<-gsub("^f", "Frequency", names(combined))
* names(combined)<-gsub("tBody", "TimeBody", names(combined))

## Step5: Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each 
Variable for each activity and each subject.
* tidy <- aggregate(. ~ subjectID+activity, data=testCombined, FUN=mean)

Export the dataset as a txt file
* write.table(tidy, "tidy.txt", sep="\t", row.names=FALSE)
